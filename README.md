Markdown is a quick an efficient tool to use get out information in a presentable fashion that is easily changable. 

Git commands are essential for collaborating on projects and will be used for the entirety of my coding career

Terminal has many commands and mastery over them provides improves speed and effiecieny in navigating files and executing tasks

The ability to create and clone repositories is specifically fascinating to me as it opens to the doors to look at many open source projects while on the path to designing my own.

Visual studio code has proven to be an effective tool in the generation of code.
